\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I am pursuing the Engineering-Security PhD and the graduate certificate in Homeland Security and Emergency Management. During this course I would like to explore some of the notions I've had over the past two years of study and see where they go. Previous classes grade on a rubric that does very little to provide feedback about merit and quality of thought. There are two areas I would like to take this time to explore. The first is cognitive bias and artificial intelligence and the second is the intersection on cybersecurity in the space domain. The former would do well as a survey paper and I'd like to create a poster for the Women in Cybersecurity conference with the latter.

After her undergraduate, she worked for JavaSoft in corporate marketing, Lycos in engineering, C-Innovation in research and development, and most recently in network operations for a Ochsner Health System in south eastern Louisiana. She took a hiatus in the 2000s to serve her country and worked primarily for the Naval Space and Warfare Command. During that time she was a trainer onboard multiple ships while underway, trainer and repair technician of EOD robots both stateside and in Iraq, worked in Fleet Operations, Navy Reserve Forces Command, and served on various tactical teams to provide services for the fleet. She is a certified repair technician for the primary man-transportable robotic systems used by the Department of Defense. Additionally she spent several years as a communications subject matter expert in the SeaBees.
\subsection{Additional History}
Ms Smith was born and raised in the San Francisco East Bay and holds degrees in chemistry and cybersecurity. She is published in both arts and science in the Journal of Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Redwood Review, and Doorknobs and Bodypaint. She also enjoys teaching and public speaking and has given talks on computing, international affairs, physical biochemistry, and robotics. Her personal awards include a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, three Navy Reserve Meritorious Service Medals, and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with M and bronze hourglass.\\Ms. Smith currently resides in DuPont, WA and is excited about finally pursuing her Olympic goals through the sport of curling.
